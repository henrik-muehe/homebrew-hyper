      HyPer requires a recent gcc, for instance 4.7. To install this, you
      should tap into Homebrew/dupes and install gcc there. Since the installer
      seems to be broken right now, gcc is not installed automatically as
      a dependency but instead needs to be build by you using for instance:

      brew tap Homebrew/dupes
      brew install gcc --use-llvm --enable-cxx
    EOS
  end
end
